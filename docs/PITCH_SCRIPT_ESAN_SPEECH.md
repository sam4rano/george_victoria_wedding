# Community-Centered Speech Technology Project  
## 5–7 Minute Spoken Pitch Script

*Use this as a rehearsal guide. Internalize the flow; don’t read word-for-word. Speak slowly. Silence signals confidence.*

## Opening (≈1 min)

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for making the time to meet with me.

I want to start by being very clear about why we are here. This is **not a sales pitch**, and it is **not a data-extraction project**. I’m not here to rush anyone into recordings or agreements.

I’m here because languages like Esan carry history, identity, and knowledge — yet they are largely invisible in modern voice technologies that people increasingly rely on every day. And I believe that if a language is going to enter the digital space properly, it must be done **with the community**, not around it or after the fact.

Today is simply a conversation: to understand whether collaboration makes sense, and if so, how it can be done respectfully and correctly.

## Why This Matters Now (≈1 min)

Voice technology is becoming the default interface — phones, education tools, accessibility systems, even government services.

The question is not *if* these systems will exist for African languages, but **how** they will exist.

If languages enter technology without context, they often sound correct on paper but feel wrong in real life — wrong tone, wrong expressions, wrong assumptions about how people actually speak.

What we are discussing is whether Esan remains something technology struggles with — or whether it becomes a language that technology understands properly, because the people who know it best helped shape that process from the beginning.

## What the Project Actually Is (≈1.5 min)

At a high level, the project explores the **development of a text-to-speech system**, and later speech recognition, for the Esan language — but done in a **community-centered way**.

This means three important things:

1. **Language content is not improvised.** Texts and expressions are created and reviewed by native speakers, not translated blindly from English.
2. **Context matters.** Language is collected across real domains — greetings, family life, markets, education, movement — not just formal or academic speech.
3. **Process comes before data.** Consent, cultural boundaries, and clarity come before any recordings.

In this initial phase, there is **no public release**, no commercialization, and no rushing. The focus is learning, alignment, and feasibility.

## Community Involvement (≈1 min)

This project is not something done *to* the community — it is something done *with* the community.

Native speakers and language experts are involved in:

- Validating pronunciation and meaning  
- Advising on appropriate usage  
- Flagging sensitive or restricted content  
- Guiding how the language is represented digitally  

**The community has veto power.** If something feels inappropriate or misaligned, it does not move forward.

That is not a formality — it is the foundation of the work.

## What’s in It for the Community (≈1.5 min)

I know this is the question people often hesitate to ask directly, so I’ll address it openly.

This project is not about immediate financial gain. But it offers **long-term value and control**.

1. **Early authority** over how the language appears in digital systems. Those who shape things early often set the standards others follow later.
2. **Documented, validated language resources** — useful for education, preservation, and future projects.
3. **A seat at the table** — if future opportunities arise (grants, tools, partnerships), the community is not reacting after the fact.

In short: this is about **visibility, stewardship, and choice**, not extraction.

## Addressing Common Concerns (≈1 min)

**Is there money involved right now?**  
No. At this stage, no one is expected to contribute funds. This phase is exploratory and collaborative.

**Who owns the recordings or data?**  
The language belongs to the community. Any recordings are used only for agreed purposes, with consent and clarity.

**Will this become commercial?**  
Right now, it is research-oriented. If future opportunities arise, they are discussed openly before decisions are made.

**Why not just record everything freely?**  
Because language without context leads to systems that sound fluent but behave incorrectly in real cultural settings.

**Can we start recording immediately?**  
My preference is alignment first. Trust and clarity come before data.

---

## Closing & Next Steps (≈1 min)

I want to emphasize that there is **no pressure** to move forward.

From here, there are only three possible next steps:

1. We decide this is not a good fit — and that’s perfectly okay.  
2. We continue discussions and refinement only.  
3. We agree on a very small, clearly defined pilot with no obligation beyond that.

What matters most to me is that if this moves forward, it does so with mutual respect, clarity, and shared ownership.

Thank you for listening, and I’m very open to your questions, concerns, or perspectives.

## Coaching (for you only — don’t say this)

- Speak **slowly**. Silence signals confidence.  
- Don’t over-explain unless asked.  
- If challenged, stay calm — you’ve already won by being transparent.  
- Let them talk. Business people want to feel heard.

*Optional next: time this to your natural speaking speed; adapt for a more traditional/community-elder setting; create a Q&A card; or rehearse pushback scenarios.*
